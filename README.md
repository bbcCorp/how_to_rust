# How to Rust?

Now, that is an interesting question about an interesting programming language.

We will explore the key concepts of this language through a series of examples. Once we have covered the basics, we will implement some common algorithms using Rust.

If you are new to Rust, you can follow the trainings and books mentioned in the reference section.


## Getting Started

Let's step into the world of Rust. 

### Validate Setup

First, let us validate the setup. We should have the rustc and cargo commands available.

```bash
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.83.0 (90b35a623 2024-11-26)

$ cargo --version
cargo 1.83.0
```

Rust has a six-week, rapid release process. To update the rust installation, use the `rustup update` utility.

### Hello World

Create a new file named main.rs and use your editor to write the following code into it:

```rust
fn main() {
	println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Use `rustc` to compile your program into an executable file.

```bash
$ rustc main.rs
./main
```

### Hello Cargo

What is Cargo? Cargo is Rustâ€™s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use it to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries.

Now, let's use Cargo to generates a boilerplate project for us. The command is `cargo new <program_name>`.

```bash
# 
$ cargo new hello-cargo

$ cd hello-cargo

# Now run the program
$ cargo run
```

It consists of a new directory named hello-cargo with a src subdirectory and adds two files: Cargo.toml and main.rs.
