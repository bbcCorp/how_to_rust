How to Rust?

Follow [this document](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to get started with rust. 


## Getting Started

Let's step into the world of Rust. 

### Validate Setup

First, let us validate the setup. We should have the rustc and cargo commands available.

```bash
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.83.0 (90b35a623 2024-11-26)

$ cargo --version
cargo 1.83.0
```

Rust has a six-week, rapid release process. To update the rust installation, use the `rustup update` utility.

### Hello World

Create a new file named main.rs and use your editor to write the following code into it:

```rust
fn main() {
	println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Use `rustc` to compile your program into an executable file.

```bash
$ rustc main.rs
./main
```

### Hello Cargo

What is Cargo? Cargo is Rustâ€™s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use it to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries.

Now, let's use Cargo to generates a boilerplate project for us. The command is `cargo new <program_name>`.

```bash
# 
$ cargo new hello-cargo

$ cd hello-cargo

# Now run the program
$ cargo run
```

It consists of a new directory named hello-cargo with a src subdirectory and adds two files: Cargo.toml and main.rs.
